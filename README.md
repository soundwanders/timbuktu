### Project Notes
  - HTML, CSS, Javascript, Skeleton CSS and a lil' extra flavor with Normalize.css
  - Library can contain book title, author, format and the relevant civilization
  - User will be able to submit new books or podcasts and create a list of materials
  - The 'library' is a table that displays an array of Objects constructed and pushed to the array
    - Delete books from the library by clicking the red 'X' button located next to each entry
    - Books are created as objects using a constructor and then pushed to the array
    - The book 'format' property has two options -> Book, Podcast
  - Skeleton CSS helped achieve a simple, responsive design that scales properly from mobile up to desktop
  - LocalStorage methods used to save and retrieve library data.
