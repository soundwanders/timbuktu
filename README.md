## Timbuktu: The Library of Ancient History
##### Current branch, 'main', only contains code for the static web application hosted on Github Pages. This version uses local storage and is not connected to Firebase.

## Project Notes
  - A project created with HTML, CSS, Javascript, plus Skeleton CSS and Normalize.css
  - Library holds Book title, author, format and the relevant civilization
  - User is able to submit their own books or podcasts and create a list of materials
  - The 'library' is a table that displays an array of Objects constructed and pushed to the array
    - Delete books from the library by clicking the red 'X' button located next to each entry
    - Books are created as objects using a constructor and then pushed to the array
    - The book 'format' property has two options -> Book, Podcast
  - Skeleton CSS helped achieve a simple, responsive design that scales properly from mobile up to desktop
  - LocalStorage used to save and retrieve library data.
